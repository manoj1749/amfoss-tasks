 	<h2>My Experience Doing Tasks</h2>
 	<p>&#9679; As I had done the tasks on my own by referring some articles and youtubes other than the given resources, I can say that these tasks aren't that easy but some tasks also aren't that hard to do.</p>
 	<p>&#9679; But I can say that I had learnt plenty of things and though I hadn't completed many of the tasks, I am looking forward to complete those remaining tasks in coming days through which I can improve my skills for making my future-self to do some wonderful-things.</p>
 	<p>&#9679; And I can say that these tasks were wonderful set of tasks beginners like me, Through which we can learn many things.</p>

	<h2>A Small Introduction</h2>
 	<p>&#9679; Myself, Manoj and I'm from Andhra Pradesh. I had completed my 11th and 12th in Vijayawada in MPC stream.</p>
	<p>&#9679; To be honest I am pretty noob in coding and programming kinda stuff but I had some mere knowledge about how these computers work and all.</p>
 	<p>&#9679; During my 12th I had go to know about github, open-source contributions, hackathons and all, I don't why I was fascinated to those things and I got some keen intrest towards them, Which made me create my github account on May 4th,2021 but due to my lack of knwowledge regarding github I wasn't able to do anything in github those days.</p>
 	<p>&#9679; I wanted to learn about it but due to my hectic schedule of classes during my 12th I wasn't able to learn anything.</p>
 	<p>&#9679; But I had gotten across an thread regarding amfoss club in quora through which I got to believe that it will be the perfect club to learn what I needed and do the things which fascinated me.</p>
 	<p>&#9679; I had also made my first PR through the workshop conducted by amFOSS club during hactoberfest and got a T-shirt装.</p>
 	<p>&#9679;And I also participated and completed my first HactoberFest by making 4 PRs with the help of basics I had learnt throught the workshop conducted bt amFOSS and completed which had gone through observation period and matured･ｳ.</p>
