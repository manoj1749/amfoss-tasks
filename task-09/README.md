# Setup a Simple Personal Website

I had followed the github repository mentioned in document for doing the tasks<br>
As there is some problem with jekyll on my macbook I had used github pages for hosting my [personal-website](https://manoj1749.github.io/)
And I had also published [my first blog](https://manoj1749.github.io/2021/11/01/my-experiences-doing-amfoss-tasks/) regarding my experiences doing the amfoss tasks.<br>
I had embedded the link to my website and mt blog above and for safe-side I will again mention the links below.<br>
The blog I made is found when we scroll down in my website in "[My Thoughts](https://manoj1749.github.io/)" as an article.
